# Probability-of-Fraud-in-ETH-accounts
Used data analysis and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for assessing  the likelihood of fraud in Ethereum accounts.

Data was preprocessed to handle missing values. Categorial variables were converted to Numerical 
using One Hot Encoding to enhance model efficiency.

Utilized Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms to classify transactions as 
fraudulent or legitimate
